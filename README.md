## How to run
1.  First make sure all the files are in the same folder.  
2. Initiate the server by type the command:
 ```
 python Server.py server_port
 ```
 
 Where **server_port**  is the connection port and you can choose whatever port you want as long as it is > 1024. For example : 
```
python Server.py 8000
```

3. Open another terminal and initiate the client launcher by the command : 

```
python ClientLauncher.py IP_address server_port client_port movie.Mjpeg
```

Again **server_port** is the same port you use for the command above. **client_port** must also be larger than 1024. **IP_address** is the IP address of your running computer. 
For example : 
```
python ClientLauncher.py 192.168.100.4 8000 8000 movie.Mjpeg
```
